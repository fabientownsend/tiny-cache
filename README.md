# I want to learn how a cache work!

When cache are used everywhere in the software industry, I had no idea how it
work. This is why I wrote this tiny cache.

The idea here is present the different concepts of a cache and make it easy to
understand.

- Cache hit and hit ration
- Cache miss
- Storage cost
- Retrieval complexity
- Replacement policy

[Here is the code](https://github.com/fabientownsend/tiny-cache/blob/master/tiny_cache.rb)

# Demo
``` ruby
ruby demo.rb
```

# Tests
``` ruby
rspec cache_spec.rb
```
